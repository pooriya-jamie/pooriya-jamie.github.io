# ProtoPNet for Medical Image Classification

This repository contains code adapted from the ProtoPNet project (https://github.com/cfchen-duke/ProtoPNet) for the classification of medical images. The primary dataset used for this adaptation is the MedMNIST dataset (https://medmnist.com/), specifically focusing on the PneumoniaMNIST subset.

## Overview

ProtoPNet is a neural network architecture designed for few-shot image classification tasks, which are often encountered in medical imaging scenarios where labeled data is scarce. By adapting ProtoPNet to medical datasets, particularly focusing on pneumonia classification using chest X-ray images, I aim to demonstrate its efficacy in a domain where labeled data is typically limited.

## Dataset

The primary dataset used in this project is the PneumoniaMNIST subset of MedMNIST, which consists of binary-class chest X-ray images labeled as either pneumonia-positive or pneumonia-negative. The dataset comprises the following splits:

- **Training Set:** 4,708 samples
- **Validation Set:** 524 samples
- **Test Set:** 624 samples

For citing the dataset, please refer to the following papers:

Additionally, supplementary data might have been collected from external sources, which should be properly cited as per their respective licenses and guidelines.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation:** Download the PneumoniaMNIST dataset from the MedMNIST website or other authorized sources. Preprocess the data as necessary for training, validation, and testing.

2. **Model Training:** Train the ProtoPNet model using the provided code. Adjust hyperparameters and network architecture as needed based on the specific requirements of the medical image classification task.

3. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the trained model on the validation and test sets to assess its performance. Utilize appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure classification performance.

4. **Deployment:** Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it in relevant medical applications for pneumonia classification tasks. Ensure compliance with regulatory standards and ethical guidelines governing medical AI applications.

## Acknowledgments

I acknowledge the developers of ProtoPNet for providing the foundational codebase for this project. Additionally, I express our gratitude to the authors of the MedMNIST dataset for curating and releasing a valuable resource for the medical imaging community.
