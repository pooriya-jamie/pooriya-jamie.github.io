Hello, I’m Pooriya Jamie, a first-year PhD student in Communication at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), advised by <a href="https://homahm.github.io/">Prof. Homa Hosseinmardi</a>. My research examines how algorithmic curation shapes social media experiences and influences user well-being, at the intersection of human-computer interaction, data science, and socio-technical systems.  

Previously, I explored AI’s transformative potential in education, including developing AI-assisted tools to analyze student learning behaviors, studying the effects of large language models on problem-solving, and designing adaptive systems for personalized learning. These experiences shaped my broader interest in leveraging computational and human-centered methods to understand and improve experiences in digital environments.  

I am particularly interested in projects at the intersection of AI, communication, and human-centered technology, and I welcome collaborations that investigate the social and behavioral impacts of digital systems.
