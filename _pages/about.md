Hello thereðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Pooriya Jamie, an undergraduate computer science student and an enthusiastic researcher with a deep passion for machine learning, data science, human-computer interaction (HCI), and computer science education (CSE). My academic journey has equipped me with invaluable experiences, particularly as a research assistant in ML, HCI, and CSE.

In the realm of HCI and CSE, I am especially interested in learning analytics, student modeling, and enhancing education through technology, with a special focus on AI-based solutions. I am proficient in C++ and Python, bringing strong analytical and problem-solving skills to every challenge. I thrive on tackling complex problems and am always on the lookout for innovative solutions.

**Currently, I am looking for graduate studies opportunities to further my research and deepen my expertise in these fields.**

If youâ€™re interested in collaborating on research or educational projects, Iâ€™d love to connect. Letâ€™s explore how our shared interests and expertise can create exciting opportunities in these dynamic fields.
