I am a computational social scientist with a computer science background focused on the auditing sociotechnical systems and in general information ecosystem. What we observe as uers experience on platforms is a complex interaction of society and technology. General features of my work on the study of digital technologies include carefully considering the whole spectrum from pure user intention to pure platform design, performing cross-platform analysis, and putting observations into context when studying complex systems.
